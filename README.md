# Framework Projects
Repository created to share the projects I developed during this course, whose goal is to be introduced to some JavaScript-based technologies for web application development, such as Node.js and React.

## üî® Projects functionality

### 01 - JavaScript revisew
This project was developed with the intention of reviewing the content about JavaScript learned, through the creation of scripts from problem-situations passed in class.

Access the page [here](https://01-javascript-review.surge.sh/).

### 02 - Arrays and objects
The exercise was performed to fix the concepts learned about array and object methods.

Access the page [here](https://02-array-and-object-exercises.surge.sh/).

### 03 - Events
The program was created to reinforce the knowledge acquired about events in JavaScript.

Access the page [here](https://03-events-exercises.surge.sh/).

### 04 - Stock of products
Project developed with the purpose of creating a table that stores the user's product stock, displaying the data at runtime.

Access the page [here](https://04-stock-table.surge.sh/).

### 05 - Menu and BMI
The projects were developed in order to fix the contents learned throughout the 1st stage and consist of a weekly menu, where the user fills in the table with the foods he will consume each day and a BMI calculator to be able to measure body mass from the user's height and weight.

Access the page [here](https://05-menu-and-bmi-projects.surge.sh/).

### 06 - List of countries
Project created in order to fix the knowledge learned about HTTP requests with JavaScript.

Access the page [here](https://06-countries-api.surge.sh/).

### 07 - Meme generator
The program consists of a generator of memes from the consummation of two APIS (one of images of known memes and another of random phrases).

Access the page [here](https://07-meme-generator.surge.sh/).

### 08 - Portfolio
Creation of a portfolio site with some of my skills and projects developed in order to introduce to React studies. In this project, components are used, the GitHub API is consumed, the project routes are created, among others.

### 09 - Countries API and meme generator in React
The project consists of joining programs 6 and 7 present in this repository, but made in React, with the aim of reviewing for the final exam of the 2nd stage.

## üíª Technologies used 
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript): programming language
* [React](https://pt-br.react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev): create user interfaces on web pages
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs): allows the execution of JavaScript code outside the browser

## üìÅ Project access
For projects developed in React, the following steps should be followed to run them locally:

#### 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your machine
#### 2. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/ArturColen/Cotemig-frameworks-works) on your machine
* Create a folder on your computer for this program
* Open the `terminal` inside this folder
* Copy the [URL](https://github.com/ArturColen/Cotemig-framework-works.git) from the repository
* Type `git clone <URL copied>` and press `enter`
#### 3. Navigate to the folder of the project you want to test using the command `cd <folder name>`
#### 4. Inside the selected folder, run the command `npm install` to create the node_modules folder in your project
#### 5. Finally, run the command `npm run dev` and open in your browser the IP address that appears in the terminal

**Observation:** Some of the programs are not designed to be accessed on mobile devices (they are not responsive), so if used on cell phones or tablets, some functions will not run.
