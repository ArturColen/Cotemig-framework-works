Access the page [here](https://07-meme-generator.surge.sh/).

### 08 - Portfolio
Creation of a portfolio site with some of my skills and projects developed in order to introduce to React studies. In this project, components are used, the GitHub API is consumed, the project routes are created, among others.

Access the page [here](https://08-react-portfolio.vercel.app/).

### 09 - Countries API and meme generator in React
The project consists of joining programs 6 and 7 present in this repository, but made in React, with the aim of reviewing for the final exam of the 2nd stage.

Access the page [here](https://09-countries-api-and-meme-generator.vercel.app/).

### 10 - Final test 2nd stage
The program was developed to assess the knowledge acquired about React and HTTP requests during the second stage of the course. It consists of a page on which questions about games and their degree of difficulty are displayed (based on data extracted from an external API).

Access the page [here](https://10-final-test-2nd-stage.vercel.app/).

### 11 - Rock, paper and scissors
Creation of the classic hand game with React in order to reinforce the concepts learned at the beginning of this stage, especially regarding hooks.

Access the page [here](https://11-rock-paper-scissors.vercel.app/).

### 12 Final test 3rd stage
Project created as a final test for the Framework subject with the aim of practicing the main skills acquired throughout the year. To do this, a program was developed to list notes that can also be deleted, so it was possible to train the content learned about React, LocalStorage, Vite, among others.

## 💻 Technologies used 
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript): programming language
* [React](https://pt-br.react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev): create user interfaces on web pages
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs): allows the execution of JavaScript code outside the browser
* [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs): create CSS styles for React components in an elegant and encapsulated way

**Observation:** These programs are designed to be accessed on computers (they are not responsive), so if used on mobile devices, some functions will not run.
