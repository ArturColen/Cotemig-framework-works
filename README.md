## ðŸ’» Technologies used 
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript): programming language
* [React](https://pt-br.react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev): create user interfaces on web pages
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/pt-br/docs): delivers the ability to interpret JavaScript code, similar to the browser

**Observation:** Some of the programs are not designed to be accessed on mobile devices (they are not responsive), so if used on cell phones or tablets, some functions will not run.
